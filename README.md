# NC Marketplace api for FE sprint

This is an express server for use with the [fe-nc-marketplace sprint](https://github.com/northcoders/fe-nc-marketplace)

The api and database have been created in this repo and you will need to host your own version of it to work with on this sprint.

Follow the instructions below to get it setup:

# Hosting this API

In order to use this API for your sprint you will need to **fork** this repo and host your own version of the app.

## Host your PSQL DB using ElephantSQL and Cyclic

Follow steps 2, 3, 7 and 8 from the [hosting notes](https://notes.northcoders.com/courses/js-back-end/api-hosting).

## Docs

The documentation for the api is hosted on the path `/`. This contains a complete API reference with all of the endpoints available.

Check you've got your API up and running by checking one of your endpoints, for example `/api/users`, which will provide a list of users.
